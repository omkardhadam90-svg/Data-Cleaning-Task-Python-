1. **Verified column data types** and corrected incorrect ones.  
2. **Identified null values** in the dataset.  
3. **Found and removed duplicate rows.**  
4. **Detected outliers** using **Boxplot** visualization and the **IQR (Inter-Quartile Range)** method.  
5. **Handled missing values** in numeric and categorical columns using suitable methods like `mean()`, `median()`, and `mode()`.  
6. **Fixed inconsistent formatting** of values in categorical data columns.

## The data has been cleaned using,
- **Pandas** – for data manipulation and cleaning  
- **NumPy** – for numerical operations  
- **Matplotlib** – for data visualization
